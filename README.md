NOTE!!! : the video upload feature doesn't work on the server I've deployed because Vercel has a limit on how much the file size should be if uploading.
But, everything would work if you run locally...!

# You can

- upload your own videos,
- like, dislike & comment on the videos,
- subscribe to the creators,
- access your watch history, subscriptions,
- visit specific channels,
- control video & volume playback with keyboard shortcuts,
- upload your own avatar,
- change whole web-app's theme
  and much more...

# To run locally :

- git clone this repo.
- Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB set up.
- Firstly, run "npm i" in the root directory (where you can see a package.json file)..
- Change the name of "sample.env" files in backend and frontend directories to ".env", --(you can also change .env's contents if you wish, like using a MongoAtlas URI, or a custom JWT_SECRET)..
- Then run "npm run dev" while being in the directory's root.
- You shall see a string similar to "localhost:3000". Open it on your browser and enjoy!!!ðŸ˜˜
